/** Defines a class for maintaining an array of School objects
  * @author Takis Metaxas, based on previous solutions
  * KNOWN BUGS: 
  * 1. There is no limiting the weights in the [1..5] range. 
  * 2. It does not check if a School already exists in the collection
  * 3. No other bug. Likely I did not test hard enough.
  * FEATURE:-) It uses its own selection sorting method, and this can be slow 
  * for large collections of Schools. Better to have flexibility.
