All the sinks: [E, F]
All the sources: [E, F]

B is a source false
C is a source false
D is a source false
E is a source true

B is a sink false
C is a sink false
D is a sink false
E is a sink true

B is isolated false
C is isolated false
D is isolated false
E is isolated true

Yep, those checks make sense and pass.
